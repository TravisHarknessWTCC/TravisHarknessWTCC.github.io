# About Me
## My Interests
I am fascinated by new technology, and am excited to learn _how_ the hardware and software I use on a daily basis actually works.
When I am not on the computer, I spend as much time outdoors as possible. I am an avid runner and enjoy bass fishing in the lakes and ponds of North Carolina. I am happiest at the beach with my wife, Jessica, and my daughter, Claire, who turns **_2_** this Sunday, January 26th.

## Websites I recommend
One of the cooler websites I have found is [__Zoom Earth__](https://zoom.earth/). It is an interactive world weather map that shows satellite images, rain radar, forecast maps and tropical system tracks. It is very useful to follow the path of a weather event on this site because it offers real-time data, and also projects the potential future path. Another site I spend a lot of time utilizing is [__YouTube__][youtube-home]. It is an amazing resource for all types of content, and I have found channels to help me learn about everything from [Information Technology](https://www.youtube.com/networkchuck) to [repair tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/@TheCarCareNut) for my older [Toyota 4runner.](https://www.edmunds.com/toyota/4runner/2005/review/)
[__YouTube__][youtube-home] has information, tutorials, and content for everyone - here's a short list of additional topics that I enjoy on the platform:
* [Economics and investing](https://www.youtube.com/@adam.taggart) - Thoughtful Money is a great resource for anyone that wants to learn more about economics and investing. The host, Adam Taggart, is very easy to listen to and communicates complex information in a way that I can easily understand.
* [Comedy and standup performances](https://www.youtube.com/@TheComedyStore) - The Comedy Store is an historic venue in Los Angeles that consistently has some of the most well-known comedians come in to perform. It is fun to watch such big stars perform in an intimate setting.
* [Technology and coding podcasts][code camp youtube] - I find [Free Code Camp][code camp youtube] to be really fascinating because the founder is a self-taught former teacher that built this platform from the ground up. He interviews lots of sucessful people in the technology space that have taken unique paths to land a career.
